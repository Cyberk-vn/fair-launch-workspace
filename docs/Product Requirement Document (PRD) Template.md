    * *Example from BANKR:* "This document outlines the requirements for a conversational, Al-driven platform designed to enable users to perform blockchain transactions and manage their digital wallets effortlessly through messaging commands." [cite: 2] "Leveraging Al for command interpretation and integrating with Privy for wallet management, the platform aims to simplify access to actions like buying, selling, swapping, and placing limit orders on a specified blockchain (Aptos, based on project request - note: chain not specified in source)." [cite: 3] "The user interface will consist primarily of a messaging (prompt) screen, supported by necessary screens for login, account/wallet setup, and terms of service." [cite: 4] "The platform is built upon the foundation described by Bankr's Terms of Service, operating as a non-custodial service provider." [cite: 5]
