# Clanker Software Development Project Plan

This document outlines the project plan for the Clanker software development project. It helps the project team prioritize features, manage risks, track work, and define a suitable development strategy.

### **1. Project Goals**

**1.1. Project Deadline:** June 11, 2025 (within 20 days from now)

**1.2. Strategic Project Goal:** To create a DAO platform for the Aptos network where users can create, buy, and sell tokens.

**1.3. Customer-centric Goal:** To establish a foundation for the subsequent AI phase (Bankr) development.

### **2. Key Success Features**

Key success features are the core functionalities crucial for the project's success. These are mandatory requirements that must be completed on time and meet quality standards; without them, the project will not achieve its stated objectives.

- **2.1. Create Token:** Users can create tokens (via Clanker site) with essential information (image, name, symbol, market cap) and the tokens are usable.

- **2.2. Buy/Sell Clanker Token:** Successful buying and selling of Clanker tokens with verifiable transaction information.

- **2.3. Clanker Contract Deployment:** The Clanker contract is successfully deployed on the Aptos network.

### **3. Essential Features**

Essential features are necessary functionalities for the system to operate correctly. They may not be the main highlights determining success, but they are the foundation for a usable product. The project team needs to ensure these essential features are completed to meet minimum user requirements.

- **3.1. Token Deployment:** Users can deploy their own tokens on the DAO platform.

- **3.2. Token Trading:** Users can trade other tokens on the DAO platform.

- **3.3. Wallet Connection:** Users can connect their wallets to the Aptos network.

- **3.4. Project Listing & Search:** View list and search for projects and their details.

- **3.5. Legal Documentation:** Terms of Use, Privacy Policy.

- **3.6. Token Management:** Users who create tokens have the right to manage them.

### **4. Low-Priority Features (Conditional)**

Low-priority features are additional functionalities that complete the product but are not mandatory in the short term. The project can still succeed without these features in the initial version. However, if time and resources permit, the team may consider implementing them to make the product more comprehensive.

- **4.1.** AI will not be used to perform transactions or deploy tokens on behalf of users.

### **5. "Nice-to-Have" Features (Extension Conditions)**

"Nice-to-have" features are extended or enhanced ideas that add value to the product but are outside the scope of the current project. These are usually functionalities to be considered for later phases. The team can list them for reference or discussion with clients but will not prioritize their development in the short term.

- **5.1.** Add admin rights for tokens: change metadata, change token owner, grant access to contract functions.

- **5.2.** Add recipient to claim fees, choose a different address to claim fees.

### **6. Risk List**

During the execution of this short-term project, it's crucial to identify potential risks that could affect progress or outcomes. This section lists potential threats (technical, human resources, time, etc.) for the team to prepare contingency plans. Each risk is briefly described along with its potential impact on the project.

- **6.1. Risk 1: Communication limitations with the client may lead to misinformation.** (Client cannot daily call with Cyberk, necessitating extremely detailed and clear daily reports.)

- **6.2. Risk 2: The resurgence of COVID-19 may impact team productivity and project progress.**

- **6.3. Risk 3: High volume of UX deliveries.**

- **6.4. Risk 4: Scope creep/Unclear Definition of Done (DoD).**

### **7. Risk Mitigation Solutions**

For each identified risk, the project team must propose corresponding solutions or control measures. This section outlines how to minimize the likelihood of risks occurring or backup plans to limit their impact.

- **7.1. Risk 1: To mitigate potential misinformation due to limited client communication, we will:**

- **7.1.1.** Implement extremely detailed and clear daily reports.

- **7.1.2.** Proactively propose requirements to the client (@Erobos and @Jaden).

- **7.1.3.** Provide progress reports via video.

- **7.2. Risk 2: To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on productivity, we will:**

- **7.2.1.** Implement timely preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks, limiting contact).

- **7.2.2.** Conduct regular health checks for team members.

- **7.2.3.** Establish clear remote work guidelines and support systems.

- **7.3. Risk 3: To manage the high volume of UX deliveries, we will:**

- **7.3.1.** Prioritize using a sample DAO project as a development base to streamline UX implementation.

- **7.3.2.** Allocate dedicated resources for UX/UI development and testing.

- **7.4. Risk 4: To prevent scope creep and ensure clear deliverables, we will:**

- **7.4.1.** Clearly define the Definition of Done (DoD) for each task.

- **7.4.2.** Break down tasks into smaller, manageable units.

- **7.4.3.** Deliver completed parts incrementally.

- **7.4.4.** Maintain a strict change management process for any new requirements.

### **8. Project Development Strategy**

This section presents the overall strategy for successfully implementing the Clanker project, including defining key objectives, scope focus, key personnel assignments, and client coordination methods.

**8.1. Main Objective:** To complete and launch the Clanker DAO platform on the Aptos network, enabling users to create, buy, and sell tokens, by June 11, 2025. Within the first month (from the current date of this plan), focus on building core functionalities to establish a solid foundation for the subsequent AI phase of the project.

**8.2. Focus:** The top priority is to develop and complete the **Key Success Features**, including:

- **8.2.1.** **Token Creation:** Users can create tokens (via Clanker site) with essential information (image, name, symbol, market cap), and the tokens are usable.

- **8.2.2.** **Clanker Token Buy/Sell:** Successful buying and selling of Clanker tokens with verifiable transaction information.

- **8.2.3.** **Clanker Contract Deployment:** The Clanker smart contract is successfully deployed and stable on the Aptos network.

Simultaneously, ensure the completion of **Essential Features** for product usability, including:

- **8.2.4.** Users can deploy their own tokens and trade other tokens on the DAO platform.

- **8.2.5.** Users with the creator role can claim reward tokens.

- **8.2.6.** Users can connect their wallets to the Aptos network.

- **8.2.7.** View list and search for projects and their details.

- **8.2.8.** Complete Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

- **8.2.9.** Users who create tokens have the right to manage them.

**8.3. Key Personnel Responsibilities:**

- **8.3.1. Duc:** Authentication, Connect Wallet, Indexer API

- **8.3.2. Thai:** Project Detail, Admin Panel

- **8.3.3. Mai:** Homepage, Create Token

- **8.3.4. Huong:** Test Report

- **8.3.5. Kanz:** Aptos Smart Contract

**8.5. Conclusion:** This strategy focuses on completing core functionalities on time, especially the key success features, to ensure the project's strategic objectives are met. Proactive risk management and effective internal team coordination, as well as with the client, are crucial factors for success. Low-priority and "nice-to-have" features will be considered after the main objectives are completed and subject to resource availability.
