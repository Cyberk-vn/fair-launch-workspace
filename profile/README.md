BANKR Project - BackendVersion: 1.0.0 (Align with project plan or initial setup)Created By: Duc (as per project plan)Project Plan Reference: BANKR Project Development Plan, Version 1 (May 13, 2025)1. Project OverviewThis repository contains the backend source code for the BANKR project. BANKR is a conversational, AI-driven platform designed to enable users to perform blockchain transactions (buy, sell, swap, place limit orders) and manage their digital wallets effortlessly through messaging commands.The primary goal is to allow users to interact with blockchain services on Aptos (as per project request noted in PRD) via simple text commands, with AI interpreting these commands and Privy handling wallet management.2. Core Features (Backend Focus)AI-Powered Command Processing:Receives and processes text-based commands from the frontend (Corresponds to FR-001).Utilizes AI (e.g., GPT core, elizaOS - specific models TBD as per PRD) and natural language processing to understand user intent and parameters (Corresponds to FR-002).Transaction Execution:Facilitates buy, sell, and swap transactions based on user commands (Corresponds to FR-003, FR-004, FR-005).Manages the placement of limit orders (Corresponds to FR-006).Calculates and applies fees (e.g., 0.8% swap fee as per BR-008, FR-014).Wallet Interaction (via Privy Integration):Retrieves user wallet balances (Corresponds to FR-007).Fetches transaction history (Corresponds to FR-008).Handles linking/creation of Privy wallets (Corresponds to FR-009).User Account Management:Manages user login (e.g., Twitter OAuth as per FR-011 - TBD).Handles account setup processes (Corresponds to FR-012).Blockchain Interaction:Interfaces with the Aptos blockchain (specific chain details TBD as per PRD) for transaction submission and status updates (Corresponds to FR-013).Security & Compliance:Ensures non-custodial operation (BR-006).Adheres to Terms of Service and other legal requirements (FR-010).3. Tech Stack(Please update this section with the actual technologies chosen)Programming Language: [e.g., Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), Go, Java (Spring Boot)]Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL]AI/ML Libraries: [e.g., Transformers, spaCy, NLTK, specific SDKs for chosen AI models]Blockchain Interaction: [e.g., Aptos SDK, Web3 libraries if applicable]Authentication: [e.g., OAuth2 libraries, JWT]API Specification: [e.g., OpenAPI (Swagger)]Containerization (Optional): [e.g., Docker, Kubernetes]Other Key Libraries/Frameworks: [List any other significant dependencies]4. Getting StartedPrerequisites[List any software prerequisites, e.g., Node.js vX.X, Python vX.X, Docker]Access to required API keys (e.g., Privy, AI service provider, Aptos node if applicable) - manage these via environment variables.Installation & SetupClone the repository:git clone [URL_OF_THIS_REPOSITORY]
cd bankr-backend
Install dependencies:(Provide command based on your package manager, e.g., npm, pip, yarn)# Example for Node.js
npm install

# Example for Python with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables:Create a .env file by copying from .env.example.cp .env.example .env
Fill in the necessary environment variables in .env (e.g., database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets).# .env example
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your_privy_app_secret
AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key
APTOS_NODE_URL=your_aptos_node_url
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_secret_key
# Add other necessary variables
Database Setup (if applicable):(Provide instructions for database migration, seeding, etc.)# Example for running migrations
npm run db:migrate
Running the Application# Example for Node.js
npm run dev

# Example for Python (Flask)
flask run
The application should now be running on http://localhost:[PORT] (e.g., http://localhost:3001).5. API DocumentationAPI documentation will be available via [e.g., /api-docs if using Swagger UI, or link to Postman collection/external docs].Ensure to keep the OpenAPI specification (openapi.yaml or similar) updated.6.

(Adjust this structure to match your actual project layout.)7. Key Risks & Mitigations (Backend Perspective)AI Misinterpretation (Risk 1 from Project Plan):Backend to enforce strict validation of parameters derived from AI.Implement a Mandatory Confirmation Protocol (MCP) requiring explicit user confirmation for critical actions, managed via API flags.Security (Prompt Injection - Risk 5, Third-party issues - Risk 6):Input sanitization and validation for all data received from AI and clients.Secure handling of API keys and secrets.Robust error handling and logging for third-party service interactions (Privy, AI).Scalability & Performance:Design services to be stateless where possible.Optimize database queries and interactions with external services.Aptos Blockchain Interaction (Risk 4):Thorough testing of Aptos SDK integration.Graceful handling of blockchain network errors or delays.8. ContributingPlease refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to contribute to this project (if applicable).Key points:Follow coding standards (e.g., ESLint, Prettier - configure these).Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.9. License[Specify License, e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, or proprietary]This README should be kept up-to-date as the project evolves.
